# dotfiles

Main repository of my configuration files.

The most important directories:
- `.xmonad` - if you're interested in configuration of alternative *window managers*.
- `.emacs.d` - if you're interested how I'm using *Emacs*.
- `.old-stuff` - if you're interested how I've used tools in the past e.g. *Vim* or *AwesomeWM*.
